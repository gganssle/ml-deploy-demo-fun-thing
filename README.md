## Open Data, Not Your Data

The data in this repository is open source, but that doesn't mean we own it. Nor does it mean you own it. Please read the license for each dataset you plan to use and follow the owner's wishes. They're granting us the privilege of using their data, which cost them time and energy (and money), so please treat their efforts with respect. Thanks!
